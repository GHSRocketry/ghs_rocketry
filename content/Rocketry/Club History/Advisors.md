The Rocketry's club head advisor used to be Mr. Lubben, but he got busy. Eventually, Mr. Spencer took up the offer for 2023-2024, but then couldn't make it due to him becoming a coach of the Men's Rowing Team. It then went to Mdme. De Koning who heads it to this day. She saved the club as she mentioned that she would hate to see a club get cut simply because no advisor was available, but has her hands full with other clubs. It would have become an underground and non-school affiliated club, and we owe much of our in-school success to this.
