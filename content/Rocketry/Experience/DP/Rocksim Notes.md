Create GitHub for the launch files

Open rocket basically lets you build a 3D model with all the varying parts of the rocket and then it lets you launch it.

I wish it allowed you to upload custom parts or a custom model.
I wish it allowed you to import all the parameters by saving it in a file or something (I think you can save it in a file but to create this file you must first type stuff in) - I wish it was more modular like you can import a spreadsheet or something
