To contribute to this Wiki, simply write pages that contribute to the team's experience and ability.

Make sure to feature a PR on what you want to add and allow the organization to approve it.

If you want to be accredited, just write a `- [your name]` after your page is done. You can edit other pages, too, allowing hyperlinking and a beautiful database of knowledge. Good luck!

If you are getting ready for the next year, remove some of the current stuff and place it in Archives under your current year.
