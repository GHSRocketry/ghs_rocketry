Welcome to the **Official Glastonbury High School Rocketry Club Wikipedia**. This wikipedia is a database of built up knowledge over the years to help you best either start on your rocketry journey, or get even better!
It is intended to be opened with Obsidian and served on GitHub for collaboration, but as long as it can be edited and read collaboratively, all is well.
# Folders
Please create and edit folders as you find better organization strategies.

- **Archives**: These are archived info from previous years.
- **Experience/Knowledge**: A region that includes any notes about knowledge that would benefit all rocketry teams. 
- **People**: This is where the Rocketry team people are mentioned and have their own pages.
- **Resources**: Place to post any long term resources that we use or reference in the future.





In the future, add:
- Rocket Design: Anything relating to the design of the rocket, whether in 3D print design for OnShape, or even which types of components.
- Rocket Deploying: Tips and tricks or mechanisms of deploying the rocket once all
